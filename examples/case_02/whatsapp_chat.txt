1/10/24, 9:15 AM - Mark: Good morning beautiful. Where are you right now? Send me a photo so I know you're safe.
1/10/24, 9:17 AM - Jessica: I'm at the coffee shop with Emma. We're just catching up.
1/10/24, 9:18 AM - Mark: Emma again? I told you she's a bad influence. She's trying to turn you against me. Come home now.
1/10/24, 9:20 AM - Jessica: Mark, she's my oldest friend. We're just having coffee.
1/10/24, 9:21 AM - Mark: If you loved me you'd respect my feelings. You know how anxious I get when you're with her. I need you home in 20 minutes.
1/10/24, 10:45 AM - Mark: You didn't come home. I've been calling. Do I need to come find you?
1/10/24, 10:50 AM - Jessica: I'm sorry, I lost track of time. I'm on my way now.
1/10/24, 10:51 AM - Mark: You're always sorry. Maybe I should just check the phone bill to see who else you've been talking to behind my back.
1/15/24, 7:30 PM - Mark: I saw you liked Daniel's photo on Instagram. Who is he? Are you cheating on me?
1/15/24, 7:32 PM - Jessica: He's a colleague from work, Mark. I just liked a photo, it's nothing.
1/15/24, 7:33 PM - Mark: Give me your phone. I want to see every message between you two. If you have nothing to hide, you won't mind.
1/15/24, 7:35 PM - Jessica: This isn't fair. You go through my phone every week now.
1/15/24, 7:36 PM - Mark: Because I can't trust you! Every time I turn around you're sneaking around with someone. Hand it over or I'm taking it.
1/22/24, 6:00 PM - Mark: I moved the joint account to my name only. It's easier for budgeting. I'll give you cash when you need something, just ask.
1/22/24, 6:05 PM - Jessica: What? That's my salary in there too. You can't just do that without asking me.
1/22/24, 6:07 PM - Mark: I'm protecting us. You spent £200 last month on things we didn't need. This way I can make sure we save properly. You should be grateful.
1/22/24, 6:10 PM - Jessica: I need access to my own money, Mark. This doesn't feel right.
1/22/24, 6:11 PM - Mark: See, this is what Emma puts in your head. Maybe you should stop seeing her altogether. I'm the one who looks after you, not her.
2/03/24, 11:30 PM - Mark: If you ever try to leave me I will make sure you regret it. I know where your mum lives. I know where your sister works. Think about that.
2/03/24, 11:32 PM - Jessica: Please don't say things like that. You're scaring me.
2/03/24, 11:33 PM - Mark: I'm not trying to scare you. I'm telling you the truth. No one will ever love you the way I do. Without me you have nothing.
