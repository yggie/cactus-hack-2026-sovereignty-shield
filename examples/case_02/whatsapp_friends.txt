1/11/24, 3:00 PM - Jessica: Emma I need to talk to you. Things are getting bad with Mark.
1/11/24, 3:05 PM - Emma: What happened? Are you okay?
1/11/24, 3:07 PM - Jessica: He got really angry yesterday because I was at the coffee shop with you. He said you're a bad influence and that I should stop seeing you.
1/11/24, 3:08 PM - Emma: Jess, that's not normal. He's trying to isolate you from everyone who cares about you.
1/11/24, 3:10 PM - Jessica: He also checks my phone every week now. He reads all my messages and checks my call logs. If I don't hand it over he gets really angry.
1/11/24, 3:12 PM - Emma: That's controlling behaviour. Please talk to someone about this. There are helplines you can call.
1/11/24, 3:15 PM - Jessica: I'm scared if he finds out I'm talking to you about this. He monitors my location too. I have to delete these messages after.
1/23/24, 8:00 PM - Jessica: He took control of the bank account today. I can't access my own salary anymore. He says he'll give me cash when I need it.
1/23/24, 8:03 PM - Emma: Financial abuse. That's exactly what this is. Jess you need to get out of there. Can you stay with your mum for a while?
1/23/24, 8:05 PM - Jessica: He said if I leave he knows where my mum lives and where my sister works. I don't know what he'd do.
1/23/24, 8:06 PM - Emma: That's a threat. You need to document everything. Save screenshots. Talk to the police.
