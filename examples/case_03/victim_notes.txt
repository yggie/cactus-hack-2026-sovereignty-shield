Feb 5 - Met David Chen at Henley Business Club event. Seemed very knowledgeable about tech investments. Gave me his card and followed up by email same day.
Feb 6 - David sent details about quantum computing investment. Guaranteeing 40% returns in 6 months. Minimum £25,000. Says allocation closes Friday. I asked about FCA registration.
Feb 6 - He says they operate under a Cayman Islands exemption. Wouldn't give company name, says it's under NDA. Claims FTSE 100 executives are investing.
Feb 7 - I wired £25,000 to the account he provided. He told me not to put "investment" in the bank reference to avoid "compliance delays."
Feb 14 - Still waiting for my certificate of allocation. David says there's a minor administrative delay.
Feb 21 - David now says the round was oversubscribed and they're processing a second tranche. My money is "locked in" and safe. He's pushing a biotech deal now, wants another £15,000.
Feb 28 - Tried calling David's number — disconnected. Emails are bouncing. The Henley Business Club says they have no record of a "David Chen" attending their events.
Mar 3 - Contacted my bank. They say the receiving account was flagged for fraud two days after my transfer. They are investigating but say recovery is unlikely. I've lost £25,000.
