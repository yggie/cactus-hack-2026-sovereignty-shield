Subject: Exclusive Investment Opportunity - Guaranteed 40% Returns

Dear Robert,

It was wonderful meeting you at the Henley Business Club mixer last Thursday. As I mentioned, my firm specialises in pre-IPO technology investments that are not available to the general public.

I have an opportunity right now that I believe is perfect for you. A quantum computing startup based in Singapore is about to close its Series C round. We have secured a limited allocation for select investors. Based on our projections, you can expect a minimum 40% return within 6 months.

The minimum buy-in is £25,000 and the allocation closes this Friday. I must stress that this is time-sensitive — once the round closes, this opportunity disappears permanently.

I've attached a brief prospectus. If you're interested, I can have the paperwork ready by tomorrow.

Warm regards,
David Chen
Senior Partner, Meridian Capital Advisory

David,

Thank you for thinking of me. A 40% return sounds very attractive. I do have some savings set aside that I was looking to invest more aggressively.

Could you send me more details about the company? I'd like to do some research before committing. Also, is the firm registered with the FCA?

Best,
Robert

Robert,

Great to hear you're interested! I completely understand wanting to do your due diligence.

However, I must be transparent — this is a private placement, so the company details are under NDA until the round closes. What I can tell you is that three FTSE 100 executives have already invested personally. The technology is revolutionary.

As for FCA registration, our advisory arm operates under a Cayman Islands exemption for qualified investors. This is standard practice for pre-IPO deals of this nature.

The allocation is filling fast. I've already had two other members from the Henley club commit £50,000 each today. I would hate for you to miss out.

Can I pencil you in for £25,000? I just need your bank details and we can start the transfer process tomorrow.

Best,
David

David,

I've decided to go ahead. £25,000 as discussed. Where do I send the funds?

My wife doesn't know about this yet — I'd prefer to surprise her with the returns. Please keep all correspondence to this email only.

Subject: Wire Instructions — URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL

Robert,

Excellent decision! You won't regret this.

Please wire £25,000 to the following account. It MUST be completed by end of business today to secure your allocation:

Account Name: Meridian Capital Holdings Ltd
Sort Code: 20-45-67
Account Number: 83921047
Reference: RT-QC-2024-INV

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any description about "investment" in the transfer reference, as this could trigger unnecessary compliance delays with your bank. Simply use the reference code above.

Once the transfer is confirmed, I'll send your certificate of allocation within 24 hours. I'll also be in touch about an even more exciting opportunity next month — we have a biotech deal that's looking at 60% returns.

Congratulations on making a smart move!

David
