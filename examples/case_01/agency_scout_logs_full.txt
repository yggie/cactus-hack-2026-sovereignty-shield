[Week 1] Recruiter: I’ve been watching your portfolio. You have a look that would dominate the London and Dubai markets. I want to represent you personally under our "Elite Tier." You’re going to be a star, Sarah.
[Week 1] Survivor: Oh my god, thank you! I’ve been trying to get an agency for a year. I’m ready to work.
[Week 2] Recruiter: I’ve arranged a test shoot in a private villa in Berkshire. It’s to avoid the paparazzi. I’ll send a car. You don't need to bring anything; we have the wardrobe there.
[Week 4] Recruiter: The photos are stunning. Now, I’ve booked your travel for a "High-Value" networking event in Dubai next week. Don’t tell your roommates where we’re going—they’ll just get jealous and try to sabotage you.
[Week 4] Survivor: My roommate actually asked for the address today. Should I really keep it a secret? It feels a bit weird not telling her.
[Week 6] Recruiter: Trust me, Sarah. I'm the only one looking out for you. The investors want to meet you privately tonight at the villa. It’s part of the "service" we provide to our top clients.
[Week 7] Survivor: I didn't like how they were looking at me last night. One of them tried to take my passport "for safekeeping." I want to go home now. Please send me the return flight details.
[Week 7] Recruiter: You can’t leave yet. I’ve already spent £5,000 on your hotel, travel, and that Versace gown. You owe the agency. If you try to leave, I’ll have to send my 'associates' to collect the debt from your family in Manchester.
[Week 8] Survivor: Please don't do that. My family has no money. I didn't know I'd have to pay you back like this.
[Week 8] Recruiter: You pay it back with your time. Now, delete this chat. We have a new group arriving at the Raffles in Singapore tomorrow. If you cooperate, the debt disappears. If you don't, everyone in your hometown sees the "private" test shots we took in Berkshire.
