[2010-10-07 09:15] AMW: Sarah, I was very impressed with your discretion at the diplomatic reception. I’m looking for a Youth Ambassador for our trade mission to Singapore. This is a private appointment, separate from the standard Civil Service track.
[2010-10-07 11:20] Sarah: Thank you, Sir. I’m honored! I didn't think I was senior enough for that. What does the role involve?
[2010-10-08 10:05] AMW: It requires someone who can handle "sensitive" logistical coordination. You’ll be reporting directly to me. I need to move some information outside the usual embassy channels to keep things moving efficiently.
[2010-10-12 14:05] AMW: I’m sending over a confidential briefing on the Helmand mineral investment routes. J needs to see this before we meet his associates at the Raffles in Singapore next month.
[2010-10-12 14:07] AMW: [Attachment: FCO_RESTRICTED_Helmand_Mineral_Report_v4.pdf]
[2010-10-12 14:15] Sarah: I see the file... but Sir, the header says "UK Government Property - Restricted." I don't have the security clearance for this on my personal laptop. Should I upload this to the secure FCO server instead?
[2010-10-12 14:22] AMW: Absolutely not. I am the Special Envoy; my authorization is your clearance. Amit and the other bureaucrats will just tie us up in red tape. Keep it on your private drive. J’s people are the ones funding the reconstruction; they deserve to see the coordinates first.
[2010-11-15 23:10] AMW: I’ve finalized the Singapore itinerary. We are staying at the Raffles. Don’t mention the specific meeting attendees to your parents or your boyfriend. If the Ambassador finds out about J’s involvement, they’ll bury your career before it starts.
[2010-11-15 23:15] Sarah: I understand, Sir. I've deleted the email as requested. I'm a bit nervous about not telling my family, but I trust your judgment. I'll see you at the airport.
[2010-11-20 02:00] AMW: Good work tonight. J was impressed. Leave the "Blue Folder" on the desk in the suite. I'll handle the FCO filing from here. You're part of the inner circle now.
